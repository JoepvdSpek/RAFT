RAFT
================================
Welcome to RAFT's online documentation!

RAFT (**R**\ esponse **A**\ mplitudes for **F**\ loating **T**\ urbines) is a floating offshore wind turbine system modeler written in Python.

RAFT works in the frequency domain to provide highly efficient computations of the response amplitudes (RAO's) of the system.
